## Bio
I am a Research Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan. My current research involves experimental full-field techniques aimed at in vitro mechanical characterization, fatigue, and failure analysis of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. I'm interested generally in connecting mechanics to tissue deformation and failure, ranging from fatigue damage of ligaments to blunt- and blast-induced traumatic brain injury at a cellular level.

## Teaching Philosophy
<!---My teaching philosophy is simple - engineering education spans all age groups. My own first contact with engineering came in the form of building towers with my siblings out of K'nex, and to get involved, I've run a demonstration of liquid nitrogen for a Kindergarten class and -->
<!-- Ideas: French-American school demo (https://youtu.be/ET0rzPNOTpI), developed the Lincoln School class (https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/05/lincoln), gonna read to preschoolers about science, ran 3.091 recitation twice a week as a senior, developed labs for experimental mechanics and mechanics of solids and structures and intro to engineering, developed/taught summer@Brown for 5 summers, started two seminar series (grad and postdoc)-->
