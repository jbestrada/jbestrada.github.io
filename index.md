## Bio
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan. My current research involves experimental full-field techniques aimed at in vitro mechanical characterization, fatigue, and failure analysis of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee. I'm interested generally in connecting mechanics to tissue deformation and failure, ranging from fatigue damage of ligaments to blunt- and blast-induced traumatic brain injury at a cellular level.

## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy is simple - engineering, like any good structure, has a solid personal foundation with tiers of increasing refinement over years of education. To maximize the potential of our future engineers, we need to focus separately on the needs of primary, secondary, and post-secondary students. 

It's imperative to get (and keep!) kids excited about science from a young age. From running demonstrations for Kindergarteners about the wonders of [liquid nitrogen](https://youtu.be/ET0rzPNOTpI?t=115) to simply reading science books to preschoolers at Gretchen's House here in Michigan, I care greatly about fostering good science fundamentals among not just those who will be our future engineers and scientists, but every individual student. 

While in high school, a lecture series in Cosmology taught by a grad student was one of the formative, convincing experiences for my career in academia. Thus, I have a personal drive to keep high school programs strong, which I've done by not only designing and sole-teaching five summers of classes, but additionally team-revamping the [engineering curriculum](https://precollege.brown.edu/catalog/?p%5B%5D=1&t%5B%5D=33) for Summer@Brown in 2015 to create a modular, multi-week engineering program for high school students. In 2016, I [redesigned and instructed](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/05/lincoln) a semester-long Introduction to Engineering partnership with the Lincoln School to center around design and prototyping. <!--These both empowered students to take the design process from start to finish...-->

At the college level, serving as a recitation instructor twice a week for two semesters of 3.091 - Introduction to Solid State Chemistry as a senior at MIT was the affirming moment of my academic path. Since then, I've been a teaching instructor for the entire continuum of first-year engineers to graduate students, finding particular purpose in debugging Matlab code with frustrated students and designing/constructing experiments and labs. However, learning is not, nor should be, restricted the class environment, and so I've founded/organized two seminars - the Continua Research Society at Brown, aimed as an informal weekly seminar series for Solids/Fluids/Materials graduate students, and the [MPACE Postdoc Seminar Series](https://mpace.engin.umich.edu/mpace-calendar/) here at Michigan. 

## Current Research

Understanding how and why biological tissues ranging from the brain to ligaments become damaged during injurious events centers on two principal thrusts - understanding and _modeling complexity_ of these biological tissues and _experimentally testing them at relevant strain rates_. 

To date, my research has focused on cell injury criteria in injurious events such as inertial microcavitation bubbles in, and rapid compression of, neural cell cultures, and is presently expanding to _in vitro_ testing (and subsequent constitutive modeling) of ligaments using magnetic resonance imaging. 

<!--I aim to expand my research into the following directions.-->

<!--1. __Multi-rate constitutive modeling of the brain__-->
